## Requirements

- macOS 13 or later
- Xcode / Swift toolchain compatible with Swift 6.2 for local builds
- A compatible `mihomo` executable if you want to start the core from CatBar

## Quick Start

### Install a release build

CatBar currently publishes `no-core` DMG releases only. The app is distributed without bundling a Clash / `mihomo` core binary.

1. Download the DMG that matches your Mac from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/QuentinHsu/cat-bar/releases).
2. Move `CatBar.app` into `Applications`.
3. Launch CatBar from `Applications`.
4. Before first use, place an executable named `mihomo` into:

```text
~/Library/Application Support/catbar/core/
```

CatBar loads the core from that folder.

### Build from source

1. Clone the repository.
2. Build the app bundle:

```sh
make build
```

3. To build the app and DMG package together:

```sh
make dist
```

## Features

### Proxy, node, and rule inspection

- Browse proxy groups and switch nodes inline.
- Inspect provider-backed nodes, subscription usage, and expiry information.
- Search nodes and rules, expand providers, and refresh providers individually or in batches.
- Filter proxy groups by runtime mode such as `Rule`, `Global`, and `Direct`.

### Connection and log monitoring

- Monitor active connections with protocol filters, traffic sorting, and searchable host / IP fields.
- Inspect matched rules, upstream proxy chains, upload / download totals, and connection start times.
- Close one connection or all active connections.
- View CatBar and `mihomo` logs with source, level, and text filtering.

### Core lifecycle and maintenance

- Start, stop, restart, and reload the core.
- Validate selected configs with `mihomo -t` before launch.
- Clear DNS cache or FakeIP cache, check the core version, restart the core API, and update GEO data.
- Detect missing core binaries and guide users to the managed core directory.

### Menu bar workflows and settings

- Show runtime state, traffic speed, connection count, memory usage, and traffic totals in the menu bar.
- Import local YAML configs or remote subscriptions.
- Toggle system proxy and TUN mode from the popup panel.
- Configure language, appearance, launch behavior, ports, logging level, and startup options.

### Remote controller support

- Add, edit, test, and remove remote `mihomo` controllers.
- Switch between local and remote targets.
- Open the remote Web dashboard with generated connection parameters.

## Build Locally

### Common commands

```sh
make build
make dist
swift test
```

### Packaging notes

- `make build` creates `dist/CatBar.app`.
- `make dist` builds the app and DMG package.
- `WITH_CORE=1` is still supported by the build scripts for legacy bundled-core packaging, but the release workflow publishes `no-core` artifacts.
- Release automation builds separate Apple Silicon and Intel DMGs.

For release maintenance details, see [`docs/DEVELOPER.md`](docs/DEVELOPER.md).
